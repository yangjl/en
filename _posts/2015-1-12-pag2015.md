# Why I change from `bash` to `zsh`

I missed #PAG meetings two years in a row partly because of my newborn. Thanks to the social media such as [Twitter](https://twitter.com/), [Github](github.com) and [Slideshare](http://www.slideshare.net/), which keep people like me updated about the excitements in San Diego. Here, I extracted some information from web for #PAGXXIII and tried to digest the meeting info a little bit at home.  

All the tweets with the dash tag #PAGXXIII was obtained every day and was achieved in this Git repo [MeetingTweets](https://github.com/yangjl/MeetingTweets). It also included all the tweets from last years PAG meeting. Most of this code was adapted from [Stephen Turner](http://gettinggeneticsdone.blogspot.com/search/label/Twitter).
