I missed #PAG meetings (International Plant & Animal Genome Conference) two years in a row partly because of my newborn. Thanks to the social media such as [Twitter](https://twitter.com/), [Github](github.com) and [Slideshare](http://www.slideshare.net/), which keep people like me updated about the excitements (mainly biotech progresses) in San Diego. Here, I extracted some information from the web regarding #PAGXXIII and tried to digest the meeting info a little bit at home.  

All the tweets with the dash tag #PAGXXIII were obtained every day during the meeting and were achieved in this Github repo [MeetingTweets](https://github.com/yangjl/MeetingTweets). It also includes the tweets from last year's meeting. Most of this code was adapted from [Stephen Turner](http://gettinggeneticsdone.blogspot.com/search/label/Twitter).

# DAY ONE (2015-1-11)

The **'wordcloud'** of day one says that "dna sequencing data can assembly, need to see booth now". Really?
