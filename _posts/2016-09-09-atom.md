[Atom](https://atom.io/) is rapidly becoming my 2nd favorite code editor (after [RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/)). Thanks for being an open source project, many add-on `themes` and `packages` hosted on `github` make it a very flexible tool. Here, I customized `Atom` as a text editor for `markdown`, i.e., to write this blog, and a `LaTex` editor, i.e., to write my research papers.

To be clear, in this configuration, I am using a Mac system with `OS X El Capitan v10.11.6` and Atom `v1.10.2` installed.

## Basic Setting

1. In `Editor Setting`, check `Soft Wrap` and `Soft Wrap at preferred line length`. By doing this, we can take advantage of multiple panels viewing of the editor.
2. Install some `UI Themes` and `Syntax Themes` for your languages. I installed `genesis-ui` and `flatwhite-syntax` for `markdown` and `Textmate Forlatex` for `LaTex`. There are many other choices, which is the beauty of this editor.
3. There is a build-in spelling check package to correct a spelling error. Click `cmd+:` for recommendation. We can also install `Linter` and sub-packages.
4. Add `File-icons`. It is pretty beautiful for visualization (see below).

## Github

I like everything to be version controlled. Therefore, some github add-ons would be necessary.

1. `Git-time-machine` allows you to travel back in time. It shows visual plot of commits to the current file over time.  
2. `Merge-conflicts` may also worth to try.

## For Markdown

With a build-in package `Markdown Preview`, now I can be writing and viewing this blog post at the same time. What an awesome experience!

## For LaTex

1. `latextools` tends to provide all you needs for `LaTex` editing. It can compile and view PDF files. And jump to the line.
2. `linter-chktex` provides real-time stylistic checking as you write.
3. `todo-show` finds all the TODOs, FIXMEs, etc. in your projects. Note only search key words in Capitan. It could be a useful tool for `Latex` commenting and editing.
