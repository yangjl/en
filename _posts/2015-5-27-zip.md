## How to extract tar.gz file

```
tar -zxvf file.tar.gz
``` 
where, `-z` works on gzip compression automatically when reading archives; `-x`, extract archives; `-v` produce verbose output; `-f` read the archive from the archive to the specififed file.

## How to get the first few lines from the *.gz file.

```
gzip -cd *.gz | head -n 30
## gzip in a loop
for i in *.gz; do gzip -dk $i; done
```
Note `-d`, extraction and `k`, keep the original file.
