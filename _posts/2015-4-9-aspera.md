NCBI has started using 3rd party commercial software to improve SRA data transferring speeds **Aspera**. The download rate can reach to hundreds MB/s.  

Here is how to use it in Linux:

### 1. Download it:
There are multiple different stuff there [http://downloads.asperasoft.com/downloads](http://downloads.asperasoft.com/downloads). You should download this one for Linux system: [Aspera connect](http://downloads.asperasoft.com/en/downloads/8?list), high-performance transfer browser plug-in.

### 2. Install it:
It is super simple for installation.

```
ascp -i ~/.aspera/connect/etc/asperaweb_id_dsa.openssh -QT -l 100m anonftp@ftp-private.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov:/1GB ~
```
The command line utility called **ascp**, which is installed in
```
$HOME/.aspera/connect
```

### 3. Use it: 
You can test it by downloading the *1GB* file. Note that the public key file should point to *.openssh* rather than *.putty*, which was suggested by [others](http://wiki.bioinformatics.ucdavis.edu/index.php/Aspera_upload/download_to_NCBI). 
```
ascp -i ~/.aspera/connect/etc/asperaweb_id_dsa.openssh -QT -l 100m anonftp@ftp-private.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov:/1GB ~
```
